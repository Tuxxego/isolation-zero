Isolation : Zero is submod for Entropy : Zero 2. The mod puts the player in a respectable Overwatch Soldier with ID 4813 in the middle of an uprising in City 17. The Citadel is about to explode, but will 4813 be able to escape or will it be torn apart by the explosion? One thing we know for sure, he is not alone in the city. On the way the player will meet the rebels, both old and new.
